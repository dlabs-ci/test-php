What could be done better:
- using Doctrine ORM with entities and native repositories
- ProfilesRepository could return []Profile
- used code standard from original code

Possible test cases:
- No year passed but no error is shown
- Year is of invalid type but no error is shown
- No historical data but no error is shown
- Profiles are not alphabetically listed
- Empty columns do not have 'n/a'

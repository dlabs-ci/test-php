I have little experience with PHP and no experience with Symphony, so this was quite a challenge for me. 

I tried to approach the problem so the logic for getting data and dsiplaying data are separated in different classes. The idea behind is that this can be extended or parts more easily replaced. 

The future improvements are numerous: 

- an UI for end user
- access permission depending on the user
- better validation of input data
- possible export to different file formats not just display in console/UI
- API access for 3rd party developers
- a caching strategy for performance gains
- historical data with graphs
- comparing profiles
- data analysis tools so we can see how profiles perform depending on day of the week, month etc
- track also view per minute in the day not just per day

### Tests
Regarding tests I have to inform you that due to the unfortunate fact that I have virtually no experience writing tests and/or identifying test cases I chose to skip this part of the assignment in order to submit the assignment in reasonable time. This with a promise that I will learn more about automated testing.

### Product
I'm not sure I understand the part about describing how I can build a better "Product" - this really left me confused. I'm sure I will be able to answer in a direct conversation.

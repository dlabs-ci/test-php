I could build more search and filter tools to help get only the data that user wants.
I could build future for csv export, because all business analyst wants data that can be imported into excel for further analyse and displaying charts. It also would be practical to send the data directly with email, with email option in command.
I deliberately avoided complex sql statements, because php is faster for order and arrange data than MySQL especially with order by in large databases.

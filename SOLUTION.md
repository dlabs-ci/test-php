ÃŸI think the best way to make "product" better is to add extra features, because just breakdown of the total views per profiles does not provide enough data to make good bussines decision.
I think that product should have following features to be better:
- Show cost of one view. This feature would show you how much does one view costs. It would help make choices in which model invest money and it will also show us if model is that popupal because of money invested in or because audience like the model.
- Show popularity growth. This feature would show  if the model is getting more or less popular. It would help make better investing decisions and show growing trends.
- Show average time spend per view. This feature would help find out if the content is good or not. 
Because if use view the model, and does not stay there for relatively long time is that because content is not interesting enough
 - Show time and date of most views. This feature would help find out when most of our customers are online. That would help to make better plans about what time to publish and on what days.

 Im pretty satisfied with my technical solution, the only think i wanted to add was Entities and Reposetories. I was not able to do that because in bin/console there are not any commands even though maker-bundle is installed. I guess that it is that way because console is modified and it is not standard Symphony. For task as small as this one, entities does not really help you, but if the task would get bigger, they would be very helpful.

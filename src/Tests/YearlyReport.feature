My weakness are tests, because I haven't need to use it on small project, but on big project where I have been worked on we didn't use test. So on this project I will need to improve myself. 

First you need set year for which you would like to get data. Then you need to check if you get any data. When console display the table you need to check id if return success message or exceptions.
  Sometimes you can also checked type of given data.
